1) clean TypeUtil (remove all inClass methods and favor expandType + the method), 
	clean the code from those methods as if we use expandType before the method
	there should be no more any TypeVariables. Authorize Wildcards (as it is now) or expand them to something?

2) Clean/update the javadoc for classes in com.owlike.genson.reflect (Type instead of Class, etc)

3) Remove or do something with the commented code in DefaultConverters (Array, micro bench it), 
	BeanDescriptor, choose better names for the inClass, type, ofClass etc.

4) Merge the custom double parser method with the Double.parse implementation into a single method, 
	decide in this method which algorithm should be used. Check whether code needs to be cleaned.
